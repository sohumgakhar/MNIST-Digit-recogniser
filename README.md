This was a project I did for my third semester in college. It is relatively basic and extremely naive. But I thought why not upload it.
It deals with the famous MNIST dataset and the dataset was taken from kaggle. Instead of running the predictions on the entire dataset, I just ran it for the first ten images in the test dataset. The 'test_min.csv' file contains the ten images for testing and the 'train.csv' file contains the training data.
The images are just a visual representation of the testing images.
The training data was too large to upload here so I will attach the link of the dataset.
